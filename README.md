# bzTraders

bzTraders is a mobile app designed to be a comprehensive directory where individuals requiring services such
as plumbing and electrical, can easily, quickly and reliably be matched with a tradesperson.
Tradespeople will be able to create an account to list the services offered. Lastly, customers will be
able to do a comprehensive search, rmake requests and rate a tradesperson's performance.
