# bzTraders

bzTraders is a mobile app designed to be a comprehensive directory where individuals requiring services such
as plumbing and electrical, can easily, quickly and reliably be matched with a tradesperson.
Tradespeople will be able to create an account to list the services offered. Lastly, customers will be
able to do a comprehensive search, rmake requests and rate a tradesperson's performance.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the prototype up and running on your browser for user testing purposes and experience.

### Prerequisites

The things you'll need in order to use the app (prototype) and how to navigate on it is very minimal. Everything is handled on the 
browser. It is preferred that you use a tablet, laptop or desktop with Chrome browser installed for a better user experience.


### How to use

Assuming that the user (customer) has already made a search for an electrician in Belmopan, follow the following steps:
* You can click on Joe Electrical, which is at the top of the list shown on the mobile screen. 
* Clicking the Search button will give more options (scroll down). You can click on Joe Electrical at the top list 
* You can now view the profile of Joe Electrical. You should be able to see contact options, Description, Portfolio and Reviews
* You can click on Portfolio and Reviews to see previous work and ratings of the tradesperson respectively. You can scroll down to view bottom portion.
* Click on Description again. Click on Call, Text, Email and Callback icons to view content in a simulated dialog box. Click outside the simulated dialog box to close
* Click on the Search Results located at the top left corner and then click one more time to reach the home screen.

The following step mainly shows the interface of the tradesperson:
